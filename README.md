# Automatic Emotion Recognition in Healthcare Data Using Supervised Machine Learning
Emotion detection is the way towards perceiving or recognizing distinctive human feelings to incorporate satisfaction, misery, shock, happiness, dread, outrage etc. Today, advanced Machine Learning techniques are accessible that can concentrate to distinguish feelings from different types of data, for example, pictures, sounds, text, and so forth. Utilizing the correct Machine Learning model according to the reason and needs can help to get exact outcomes in emotion detection. Emotion Analysis has a surprising commitment in different enterprises to incorporate medical services, promoting, amusement, surveillance, retail, online business etc.

We propose a methodology using supervised machine learning techniques to predict emotion type in online health data. In this regard, EmoHD dataset is prepared to train six different supervised machine learning models using a variety of feature engineering techniques. Moreover, predicting the emotion from health-related content will help to filter out negative emotions to avoid medical health issues either mental or physical. Furthermore, the presence of negative emotions in a person eventually leads to extreme stage, i.e., suicide. Therefore, we believe that our proposed work will help the health communities to avoid such mishaps.
